The official implementation of the paper [An Automated Method for the Creation of Oriented Bounding Boxes in Remote Sensing Ship Detection Datasets](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/WACV2024W/MaCVi/html/Savathrakis_An_Automated_Method_for_the_Creation_of_Oriented_Bounding_Boxes_WACVW_2024_paper.html)
Given images with objects with Horizontal Bounding Box annotations, the proposed method can create reliable Oriented Bounding Boxes, with a pipeline consisting of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), a morphological closing and a contour detection operation.
